# At CYHZ
Tower release (TR) is automatically granted once confirmation of the active runway is communicated. Should YHZ_TWR utilize a non-active runway for departure they must obtain a TR from the position covering YHZ_APP. 

A TR request may be verbally processed or through the use of VATCANSitu release request function. If the Tower prefers VATCANSitu, inform the departure controller so they can be vigilant of requests. 

# At All Other CZMQ/CZQX Airports
All other airports in the CZQM/CZQX FIR require prior coordination of a TR. The radar position covering terminal or departure services may authorize blanket TR authority depending on their circumstances. 


A TR request may be verbally processed or through the use of VATCANSitu release request function. If the Tower prefers VATCANSitu, inform the departure controller so they can be vigilant of requests.
