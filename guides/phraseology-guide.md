# Radio Checks
From time to time an aircraft before requesting any clearance may perform a radio check. The table below describes the readability levels for both the pilot and controllers:

| Scale | Readability |
| ----- | ----------- |
| 1 | Unreadable |
| 2 | Infrequently Readable |
| 3 | Readable with dificulty |
| 4 | Readable |
| 5 | Perfectly Readable |

(Aircraft) **[ UNIT ID ]** read you **[ READABILITY ]**

> Aircraft Calling, Moncton Center, read you 3 by 5

# Communication Transfer
When transfering control of an aircraft to another controller, it is essential to ensure it is clear who the pilot is being transfered to.

| Station | Transfer Phraseology |
| --- | --- |
| Radar / Domestic | Contact |
| Radio | Call |
| Unicom / Tower (when coordinated) | Monitor |

> When transfering from ground to tower, a plane may be told to "Monitor tower". This may be used to help free up the towers frequency allowing the tower controller to just assume that when a piece of traffic is holding short, they are already on their frequency without the pilot needing to speak on frequency.
>
> This **MUST** be coordinated between ground and tower before being done.
{.is-warning}

(Aircraft) contact **[STATION]** on **[FREQUENCY]**

> ACA123, contact Moncton Center on 132.2 

> CGABC, monitor Unicom on 122.8

> AAL134, call Gander Radio on 5.649
